abstract = {This work studies queues in a Euclidean space. Consider N servers that are distributed uniformly in [0,1]d. Customers arrive at the servers according to independent stationary processes. Upon arrival, they probabilistically decide whether to join the queue they arrived at, or shift to one of the nearest neighbours. Such shifting strategies affect the load on the servers, and may cause some of the servers to become overloaded. We derive a law of large numbers and a central limit theorem for the fraction of overloaded servers in the system as the total number of servers N→∞. Additionally, in the one-dimensional case (d=1), we evaluate the expected fraction of overloaded servers for any finite N. Numerical experiments are provided to support our theoretical results. Typical applications of the results include electric vehicles queueing at charging stations, and queues in airports or supermarkets.}

Each layer is associated with an independent realization of a d-uniform HSBM on N vertices. Given the similarity matrix containing the aggregated number of hyperedges incident to each pair of vertices, the goal is to obtain a partition of the N vertices into disjoint communities. In this work, we investigate a semidefinite programming (SDP) approach and obtain information–theoretic conditions on the model parameters that guarantee exact recovery both in the assortative and the disassortative cases.},

  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
