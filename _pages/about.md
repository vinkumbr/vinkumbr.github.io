I am a post-doctoral researcher at [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://research.tue.nl/en/organisations/statistics-probability-and-operations-research/persons/) working with [Nelly Litvak](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/researchers/nelly-litvak) and [Remco van der Hofstad](https://www.win.tue.nl/~rhofstad/). I am funded by the NETWORKS COFUND program. Prior to this, I spent two beautiful years in [INRIA Sophia Antipolis - Méditerranée](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-sophia-antipolis-mediterranee) working with [Konstantin Avrachenkov](https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Konstantin.Avratchenkov/me.html) in the [NEO](https://team.inria.fr/neo/) team. I did my Ph.D. in the Department of ECE at the Indian Institute of Science under the guidance of [Navin Kashyap](https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~nkashyap/). My thesis was titled "<a href = "assets/pdf/IISc_Vinay_thesis.pdf">***Probabilistic Forwarding of Coded Packets for Broadcasting over Networks***</a>".

Broadly, my research falls in the area of ***random graphs*** and ***network science***. I am interested in problems that involve a graph structure and complex interactions between the network elements. My research goal is to propose and analyze robust mathematical models that capture different physical phenomena observed on practical networks.
