I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href='https://www.ieor.iitb.ac.in/'>Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (IEOR)</a> at IIT-Bombay.


Broadly, my research falls in the area of ***random graphs*** and ***network science***. I am interested in problems that involve a graph structure and complex interactions between the network elements. My research goal is to propose and analyze robust mathematical models that capture different physical phenomena observed on practical networks.
