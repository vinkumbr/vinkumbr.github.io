### Site percolation on $$\mathbb{Z}^2$$ 

The below plot is obtained by finding the largest cluster of open sites on a $$501 \times 501$$ square grid.

### Continuum percolation on $$\mathbb{R}^2$$ 

The below plot was obtained by finding the fraction of nodes in the largest connected component in a random geometric graph of intensity $$\lambda$$ deployed over a $$251 \times 251$$ area and where two nodes that are within unit distance are connected to each other.
