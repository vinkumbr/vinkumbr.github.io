During the course of a pandemic, the spread of the disease within a population manifests itself in the number of new infections each day. While this number is, in general, unknown to us, it can be estimated from observables such as the number of cases that test positive each day. The aim of this project is to build an estimator for the unknown time series, I(t), formed by the daily number of new COVID-19 infections, based on the observed time series, P(t), of the number of hospitalized cases that test positive each day.

Joint work with Prof. Navin Kashyap, Prof. Manjunath Krishnapur, Arvind Rameshwar, Jnaneshwar B.S. and Anand Jerry George.
